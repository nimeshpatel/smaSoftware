I have tried to clean up the /application/bin directory as
much as possible. I have made directories to save old and
test version of programs which are not currently in use.

For example, I store old flux scripts in flux.scripts.

If you had something here and it is no longer here,
it is most likely in a sub-directory. I did not delete
anything, just reorganized. Anything I couldn't classify
went into testing_scripts/.
