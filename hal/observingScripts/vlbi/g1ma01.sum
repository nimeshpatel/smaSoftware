DERIVED INFORMATION FOR CORRELATION: 

  Elapsed time for project:         17.83 hours.
  Total time in scheduled scans:    11.33 hours.
  Total time in recording scans:    11.33 hours.
  Total number of baseline hours:   92.12    (Recording scans only)
  Projected maximum data output rate from the correlator:     344.1 kbytes/sec of observe time.
  Projected correlator output data set size:        5433.3 Mbytes
  NOTE:  Above numbers assume the same correlator parameters are used for all data.
    NOTE:  Output data set size large.  Consider requesting high density tapes.

 **** WARNING *****
      Overlapping scans were detected.  Either there was subarraying
      or some stations were scheduled separtely from others.
      If the latter, the output data rates and volume are underestimated
      because the number of baselines is underestimated.

Notes on the station summaries: 

    "Record Scans" are periods of recording with no gap.  The Mark5A disk systems 
    have a limit of 1024 such scans.  There are often multiple projects on a disk pack.
    Try to keep above about 6 GB per record scan by using MINPAUSE and PRESTART 
    to prevent short gaps.  However, also try to prevent record scans of more than
    an hour to minimize risk to data from playback problems.

    "Sync Hours" is on-source, in-scan time lost during correlation to resyncing
    recordings.  Resyncs follow tape stoppages and formatter reconfigures.

    For VLBA DAR stations, total reconfigures and reconfigures during recording are shown.
    Reconfigures during recording can cause slow correlator sync.
    Any reconfigure can slow sync at JIVE.

  The solar corona can cause unstable phases for sources too close to the Sun.
  SCHED provides warnings at individual scans for distances less than 10 degrees.
  The distance from the Sun to each source in this schedule is:

  Barry Clark estimates from predictions by Ketan Desai of IPM scattering sizes 
  that the Sun will cause amplitude reductions on the  longest VLBA baselines 
  at a solar distance of 60deg F^(-0.6) where F is in GHz. 
  For common VLBI bands, this is: 
       327 MHz        117. deg 
       610 MHz         81. deg
